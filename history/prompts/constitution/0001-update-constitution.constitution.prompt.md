## Prompt

```
Project: Hackathon-II-phase-I-todo-in-Memory
Title: In-Memory Todo CLI Application (Spec-Driven Development)

Objective:
Design and implement a Python-based command-line Todo application that stores all tasks in memory.
The project simulates the first evolutionary stage of a software system, focusing on correctness,
clarity, and spec-driven development using AI-assisted tooling.

Core principles:
- Spec-first development: No code is written without an approved specification
- Deterministic behavior: CLI actions must produce predictable, testable results
- Simplicity over complexity: In-memory only, no persistence layer
- Clean architecture: Clear separation of concerns (models, services, CLI interface)
- AI-assisted development: Claude Code is the primary implementation agent

Technology standards (mandatory):
- Programming language: Python >= 3.13
- Environment & dependency management: UV only
- Specification framework: Spec-Kit Plus
- Code generation & refinement: Claude Code
- Operating environment: Linux (WSL 2 compliant)

Functional scope (Phase I – Basic Level):
The system MUST implement exactly the following five features:
1. Add a task with:
   - Unique ID
   - Title (required)
   - Description (optional)
   - Completion status (default: incomplete)
2. View all tasks with clear status indicators
3. Update task title and/or description by ID
4. Delete a task by ID
5. Mark a task as complete or incomplete by ID

Non-functional standards:
- All data is stored in memory only (no files, no database)
- CLI interface must be human-readable and intuitive
- Errors must be handled gracefully with clear messages
- Code must follow Python clean code conventions
- No unused code, dead logic, or premature abstractions

Project structure requirements:
- /src directory containing all Python source code
- specs/ or specs-history/ directory containing all specifications and revisions
- Constitution file generated by Spec-Kit Plus
- README.md with:
  - Project overview
  - Setup instructions using UV
  - How to run the CLI application
- CLAUDE.md defining:
  - Claude Code usage rules
  - Spec-driven workflow expectations

Specification governance:
- Every feature must originate from a written specification
- Specification changes must be tracked in spec history
- Implementation must strictly follow the latest approved spec
- If ambiguity exists, clarify via specification updates before coding

Constraints / Scope:
- In-memory data storage only
- Single-user, local CLI only
- No external frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, Click, Typer)
- No network or cloud dependencies

Success criteria:
- All five required features implemented and demonstrable
- Application runs successfully via CLI using Python >= 3.13
- Repository structure matches defined standards
- Specs, constitution, and code are fully aligned
- Clear evidence of spec-driven development suitable for hackathon evaluation
```

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md with concrete values based on the user input. The new constitution includes:

1. Core Principles:
   - Spec-First Development
   - Deterministic Behavior
   - Simplicity Over Complexity
   - Clean Architecture
   - AI-Assisted Development
   - Python Clean Code Standards

2. Technology Standards section
3. Development Workflow section with Specification Governance and Implementation Constraints
4. Governance section

The constitution now properly reflects the requirements for the In-Memory Todo CLI Application with spec-driven development principles.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created initial constitution file with project-specific principles and governance
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md, created history/prompts/constitution/0001-update-constitution.constitution.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implement the todo application features as per spec
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution now properly captures the project's core principles and constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing the todo application features based on the constitution
